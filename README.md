Using Stackdriver Logging on App Engine Standard is complicated. It doesn't
have to be that way.

```go
package main

import (
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "net/http"
  "os"

  "github.com/mtraver/gaelog"
)

// wrappedHandler must be wrapped using gaelog.Wrap or gaelog.WrapWithID so that the
// request context can be used with the package-level logging functions.
type wrappedHandler struct{}

func (h wrappedHandler) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  if r.URL.Path != "/" {
    http.NotFound(w, r)
    return
  }

  ctx := r.Context()

  gaelog.Debugf(ctx, "Debug")
  gaelog.Infof(ctx, "Info")
  gaelog.Noticef(ctx, "Notice")
  gaelog.Warningf(ctx, "Warning")
  gaelog.Errorf(ctx, "Error")
  gaelog.Criticalf(ctx, "Critical")
  gaelog.Alertf(ctx, "Alert")
  gaelog.Emergencyf(ctx, "Emergency")

  message := struct {
    Places []string
  }{
    []string{"Kings Canyon", "Sequoia", "Yosemite", "Death Valley"},
  }

  gaelog.Info(ctx, message)

  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello!")
}

// manualHandler creates and closes a logger manually. This usage does not require
// gaelog.Wrap or gaelog.WrapWithID.
func manualHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  lg, err := gaelog.New(r)
  if err != nil {
    // The returned logger is valid despite the error. It falls back to logging
    // via the standard library's "log" package.
    lg.Errorf("Failed to make logger: %v", err)
  }
  defer lg.Close()

  lg.Warningf("Some important info right here, that's for sure")

  fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello!")
}

func main() {
  // Wrap the handler.
  http.Handle("/", gaelog.Wrap(wrappedHandler{}))

  http.HandleFunc("/manual", manualHandler)

  port := os.Getenv("PORT")
  if port == "" {
    port = "8080"
  }
  log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(fmt.Sprintf(":%s", port), nil))
}
```

## What's it doing under the hood?

At its core, `gaelog` is setting up the `MonitoredResource` and trace ID of the
underlying Stackdriver Logging logger. The trace ID is retrieved from the
`X-Cloud-Trace-Context` header and the app info is retrieved from environment
variables.

On App Engine the `MonitoredResource` is set as follows to match that set by App Engine
itself on request logs. The type, `"gae_app"`, is the literal value that App Engine uses
(and `gaelog` mimics). The other strings below are placeholders for your app's info.
```
resource: {
  labels: {
    module_id: "my-service-id"
    project_id: "my-project-id"
    version_id: "my-version-id"
  }
  type: "gae_app"
}
```

## Logging on Cloud Run

Imagine you containerize your App Engine app and deploy it to Cloud Run. It would be nice
if logs were still correlated on Cloud Run, right? Well, they will be. If the app info
as expected on App Engine is not present then `gaelog` will look up the info as it's
expected on Cloud Run.

On Cloud Run the `MonitoredResource` is set as follows to match that set by Cloud Run
itself on request logs. The type, `"cloud_run_revision"`, is the literal value that
Cloud Run uses (and `gaelog` mimics). The other strings below are placeholders for your
revision's info.
```
resource: {
  labels: {
    configuration_name: "my-config-name"
    project_id: "my-project-id"
    revision_name: "my-revision"
    service_name: "my-service"
  }
  type: "cloud_run_revision"
}
```

## Known issues

1. **Request log (aka parent) severity is not set.**
A nice property of `google.golang.org/appengine/log` is that the severity of the request log entry (aka
parent entry) is set to the maximum severity of the log entries correlated with it. This makes it easy
to see in the Stackdriver UI which requests have logs associated with them, and at which severity. Alas, that
is not possible with this package. App Engine itself makes the request log entries and it does not know about
any correlated entries created separately (such as with this package). Furthermore, entries cannot be modified
after they are created. A possible remedy is for this package to emit request log entries of its own; open an
issue if you'd like this and we can discuss.

1. **If a request has any log entries made by `google.golang.org/appengine/log` or App Engine itself,
then entries made by this package will not be correlated (i.e. nested) with the request in the Stackdriver
Logging UI.**
Such logs are "embedded" logsâ€”if you expand the request log entry you'll see the other log lines embedded
there in the data structure. Embedded and correlated logs do not play nicely together. An annoying consequence
is that requests that start a new instance or that time out will not be correlated with logs emitted via this
package because App Engine adds embedded logs on such requests. This issue is not solvable in this package.
